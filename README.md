# Learning C
Author: Pat Harrington  
Date: 1/27/2024


## Description
I created this repository as an exercise in learning the C Programming Language. The idea is to push frequent, functional projects 
as often as possible, allowing me to track and showcase my progress. I have found that a goal is necessary when learning
something new, and this, albeit simple, provides me that goal. Everything about this project is a learning experience. The
code, the use of Git, even the writing of this README.md.

## Usage
1. Save .c file in desired directory.
2. Compile (ex. $ gcc file.c -o file)
3. Run (ex. $ ./file)
